## Scope of the Unofficial Patch

We accept fixes for the following issues. Some issues might span multiple categories. 

* **Crashes** Naturally. Only one of these so far.

* **Exploits** Things that were clearly not intended by the developers. Generating infinite resources, typically.

* **Functionality** A 'general bug'. Something straight up doesn't work, or works inappropriately.

* **Oversights** These are issues that may surprise the player when encountered, though they may not technically be bugs. These aren't balance per se, but rather player frustration, or if the player gets away with something it seems like they shouldn't. 

* **Balance** For a balance fix to make it in, something needs to be seriously wrong. Not just 'this feels unbalanced' but 'this dramatically impacts game experience and is clearly inappropriate'. 

* **Performance** These fixes do not impact gameplay, but remove extraneous processing.

* **Mod Support** Fixes that do not affect vanilla gameplay, but instead ensure that mods adding certain things, like new government types, do not break parts of the game.

* **AI Improvements** Tweaks to the AI to make it handle situations more intelligently. Some of these are taken from Glavius or StarNet.

* **Cosmetics** Typos, incorrect icons, graphical issues, and other elements that do not impact gameplay in any fashion.  

## What is out of scope

* **Tuning** If something is functioning but merely 'unbalanced', it isn't our job to fix it. Tuning is only appropriate when necessary as a part of a larger fix, where numbers are needed and Paradox provides none.

## Usage

### Mod Authors

Feel free to forward these changes to your mods. We appreciate pointing people to this project, as it makes more Stellaris fans aware of it. 

### Users

This mod should go at the very top of your load order, so other mods overwrite it.

#### In Progress Games

* Don't activate this mod in the middle of the Ice Aliens project. If you've got them, wait for it to run its course first.

* Currently, some things that could be fixed in an in-progress game aren't. The most notorious of these is the Unbidden being hostile to their own portal - you definitely want to have this in before the endgame crisis.

#### Compatibility

* Mods that allow multiple ascensions. Making such mods based off of this patch is utterly trivial, and I might toss my personal mods up.  

* Everything else should be compatible. If not, it's a bug.

## Contributing

I highly suggest using a three-way merge tool, such as [Winmerge](https://winmerge.org/), when managing this project. It makes updating for new releases, evaluating other fixes, and so on a comparative breeze. Updating this project to a new Stellaris release takes me a couple hours, roughly.

### A Note on Incorporating Fixes

Many times, I have seen 'fixes' that do not actually address the issue. Just because another mod exists that claims to fix something, does not mean it does. Many of them paper over the issue, and the result is a borderline exploit or cheat.

## Branch Policy

Every major (x.x) release of Stellaris will get its own branch (2.6, 2.7, etc). 'Master' will be used as the general development branch for the current version.
