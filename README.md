# Unofficial Patch for Stellaris

## AI **•** Bugfix **•** Mod Support **•** Performance

This mod corrects several hundred issues in vanilla Stellaris. The game is faster, the AI is smarter, mods are better supported, and fewer bugs will be encountered.

The severity of these has ranged from typos to game crashes.

* This mod has fixed two game crashes so far. Both are now fixed by Paradox.

It is not achievement compatible.

A small portion of this mod [has been incoporated into 3.11](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-330-community-fixes-in-eridanus.1623475/). They included about twice the fixes listed, but it is normal for Paradox to only include about half the fixes they make in a given patch in their changelogs.

This is not a balance patch. Paradox absorbed most such changes from this mod in 3.11, and a good portion of what balance items remained is now removed.

I am working on a balance mod to eventually host most of the leftover balance items, along with more drastic changes.

# Usage

This mod goes at the top of your load order. If you are also using [Vanilla fixes by Harain](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3013030800&searchtext=vanilla+fixes), that should go first as everything but graphical fixes gets incorporated or is rendered irrelevant by this patch. 

## In Progress Games

There are no expected issues with adding this to or removing this from a running game.

## Compatibility

Most everything is compatible, except for multi-ascension path mods. If you want to combine biological ascension with other ascensions, [I have made a mod for just that](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2469236146).
