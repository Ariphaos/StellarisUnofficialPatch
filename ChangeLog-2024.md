# Change Log - 2024

## February 27th

- 3.11 Update. Yes, this still fixes several hundred bugs; Paradox only got to a fraction of them. About twice as many as they listed, though their patch notes usually only document about half of the fixes they get to in a major patch, so this is no real surprise.
- There are a few I know they looked at and did not adopt. Some of these have been removed, some were oversights, some will get moved to the balance patch, some I am not sure if they figured the why of it. These have / will be listed in the documentation.

- I have begun a project to document every change this patch makes. It is a colossal undertaking, and I am not yet finished, but you can see the work so far in the various Changes- files. I will attempt to keep them updated.
- With this I have reverted a number of chances to better prepare for moving to a build system. This will make the project easier to maintain, and more powerful for modders to rely on.

- Dystopian living standard also decreases slave political power.

## February 21st

- Final 3.10 release.

- Fix for terraforming candidate not being removed on terraforming directly to a machine world.
