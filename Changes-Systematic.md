This is to document and explain new systems the patch introduces to correct bugs. They don't change anything existing.

# Features

## Juggernaut Shipyard

* Policy is available to disable.

# AI 

## Autoprune

(Currently disabled.)

This was a part of my initial economic rework, to demolish districts that the AI shouldn't be needing anymore.

# Bugfixes

## Mass Purging

(Currently Disabled)

This was originally written to get around the rather exploitable original system. The new system seems to be simultaneously too fast and too slow depending on the number of pop groups. It will need to be rewritten.

## Soldier Counting

These events track soldier counts for limited types - Azizians, Imperial Legion, and Titanic Life. They allow you to purchase new ones if one dies, and occasional recounts track things there is no current trigger for.

# Modding

## Variables for mods

Allow mods to set variables to change various elements in the game and this patch more consistently. These are located and documented in `common/scripted_variables/~~ariphaos_patch_overridable.txt`.
