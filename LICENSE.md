# License

As an unofficial patch for a commercially available game, the author does not have the ownership of the overwhelming majority of files presented in the source folder, and thus no particular license can be granted to them. By default, the copyright to non-transformative derivative works is owned by the original publisher, and thus the resulting mod is owned by Paradox Development Studio.

I try to give credit where possible to original authors and regular contributors, noted in Credits.md, as well as the yearly changelog files. 

If you use this mod as a basis for your own, or forward changes into your own mod, credit is appreciated, though not strictly required.
