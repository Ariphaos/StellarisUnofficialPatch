* [Risa's Unofficial Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=803752381) is the original mod this one was based off of. Between removing 'balance' fixes, and things Paradox or I have made irrelevant in the interim, there are still a couple dozen fixes Risa still has credit for, depending on how you count them.

* [Bug Fixes by alexrider903](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1911222615) Along with Risa's fixes and my own, these made up the original patch.

* [Bugfixes by ECHO](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785269836) covered a few mod-compatibility issues Risa did not.

* [Community Flash Patch by Roverstorm](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2026808491) Made a number of fixes later in the 2.x era that I have applied.

* [Modifiers fix by jasonpepe](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1688887083) for economic modifiers. My patch doesn't incorporate anything specific to a single mod, so most things actively requiring this mod still do.

* [SirBlackAxe's Unofficial Bug Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2848761444) made a lot of fixes and AI improvements, and is the largest overall contributor to the current patch besides myself.

* [Glavius AI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1584133829) I ate this entire thing.

* [StarNet](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1712760331) With it no longer being fully maintained, I intend to make this mod largely obsolete over the next few release cycles, though I want to maintain a reasonable experience.

* [Fireprince](https://github.com/F1r3Pr1nc3) has made significant contributions both on Github here and in direct communication.

* [Vanilla fixes by Harain](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3013030800&searchtext=vanilla+fixes) Fixes things that generate error lines. You may still wish to use this (put it *before* my mod) as it includes some graphical fixes.
